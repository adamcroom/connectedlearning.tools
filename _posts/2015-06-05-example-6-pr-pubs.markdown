what: <p>This is a course at the University of Oklahoma that has been highly influence by most of the folks on the panel! Thanks Alan Tim, and Laura for helping me think through this idea!</p>

equity: <p>One connected learning principle is Openly Networked. I'm a big fan of the idea of how we share our tools (like how I'm hacking into this panel!)</p>

skills: <p>I teach how non-technical students how to design. But rather than teaching them how to build a domain, you learn through building the domain. It's not an end product but rather it's the pedagogy.</p>
challenges: <ul> <li>Time investment</li></ul>
