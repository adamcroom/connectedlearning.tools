description: <h4>What it is? (~1 tweet length)</h4><p>Use a plugin in a Wordpress self hosted site that aggregates content from external sites via RSS</p><h4>How this Creates a Connected Learning Space (~2 tweets length)</h4> <p>All work and activity by participants are done in spaces they manage, anything from a self hosted blog on a personal domain to a free hosted one. Other social media sources (tweets, photos, diigo groups) can be syndicated in if they have an RSS feed. Everything can be organized then on the aggregating site a hub of activity.</p><h4>How This Demonstrates Equity By Design?</h4> <p>It gives control over all content, and personal representation, to the individual.</p><h4>The Origin Story</h4> <p>You should travel back to 2001 <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2014/11/18/motherblog/" target="_blank">to hear how Barbara Ganley built what became known as "the mother blog"</a> for her writing students at Middlebury College. This was created with modifications to then hosted MovableType blog platform.</p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24nUf5-BEe8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Inspired by the motherblog concept and fueled by the vision of Gardner Campbell for <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/personal-cyberinfrastructure" target="_blank">A Personal Cyberinfrastructure</a>, the DTLT at University of Mary Washington implemented early examples on their multi site Wordpress platform, <a href="http://umwblogs.org/" target="_blank">UMW Blogs</a> (the <a href="http://studyabroad.umwblogs.org/" target="_blank">UMW Abroad</a> site has aggregated blog posts from students traveling abroad since 2009).</p><p>The Wordpress / Feed Wordpress platform was the foundation for <a href="http://digitalstorytelling.umwblogs.org/" target="_blank">the first DS106 Digital Storytelling course</a> built by Jim Groom in 2010 and has evolved and expanded into the <a href="http://ds106.us/" target="_blank">open DS106 courses</a> taught many times at UMW and elsewhere since 2011.</p><h4>Front Stage Demo (what it looks like to the public)</h4> <iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYh6VTLrLSE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h4>Back Stage Demo (what it looks like to manage)</h4> <iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WppuAdvD2zk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h4>Technologies and Costs</h4> <ul> <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Self Hosted Wordpress</a> (open source)</li> <li>Commodity Web Hosting and Domain Registration ($5-$40/year for domain depending on domain; $25-$45 / year for hosting) - Depending on number of sites aggregated, this can be run on any shared web hosting platform, bigger sites (100+ feeds?) might need a better package. We recommend starting with <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/" target="_blank">Reclaim Hosting</a> but also viable are <a href="http://bluehost.com/" target="_blank">Bluehost</a>, <a href="http://dreamhost.com/" target="_blank">Dreamhost</a>, <a href="http://mediatemple.com/" target="_blank">Media Temple</a>, <a href="http://asmallorange.com/" target="_blank">A Small Orange</a>, and many more. </li> </ul> <h4>Skill Levels Required</h4> <p>Advanced web skills / programming not required for a basic setup.
