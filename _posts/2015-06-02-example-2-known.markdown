examples: <p><a href="http://www.aud.life/" target="_blank">Audrey Watters</a>, <a href="http://www.leoville.net/" target="_blank">Leo Laporte</a>, <a href="http://links.windley.com/" target="_blank">Phil Windley</a>, <a href="http://www.endless.systems/" target="_blank">Warren Ellis</a></p>

what: <p><a href="https://withknown.com/education/" target="_blank">Known</a> is a personal learning environment for the connected student. Publish course projects, reflect on your learning, and share ideas with your peers.</p>
how: <p>Known bridges the gap between a private, reflective space and a community platform. Everyone gets their own space to publish and reflect. However, by sharing ideas with their class group, students get valuable feedback and new insights on their learning.</p>
equity: <p>Known is un-hierarchical. For the purposes of publishing and discussion, every user is equal to every other user. Furthermore, <a href="https://withknown.com/opensource/">the platform itself is open source</a>, and can be adopted and modified by any size of institution.</p>
origin: <p>The founders of Known came together at <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com" target="_blank">IndieWebCamp</a>, an event centered around empowering users to own their own conversations and content online. Separately, we had cofounded <a href="http://elgg.org" target="_blank">Elgg</a>, the community platform for education, and worked with brands like Microsoft, eBay and Intel. We saw a need to create a user-controlled publishing space for the social media age, that worked as well on a phone as it did on a computer, and that had social connectivity built into the core of its design.</p>

tech: <p>Known is built on a LAMP stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, similarly to WordPress. It can be run on a single site, or scaled up to handle publishing across a campus. <a href="https://github.com/idno/known" target="_blank">The core platform is open source</a>, while course discussion, campus management software and support are available with an annual license. The platform is fully-responsive and works well on any device, and native mobile apps are coming soon.</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://withknown.com/education" target="_blank">a fully-hosted turnkey service exists</a>, where 200 users can collaborate on a website with unlimited storage and bandwidth, including CDN, for $6 a month. Campus-level hosting and <a href="https://withknown.com/services/">bespoke services</a> are also available.</p>
skills: <p>Self-hosting Known requires some understanding of server administration. The managed version requires no technical knowledge, and comes with support.</p>

challenges: <p>Any community needs to be led by example. The biggest challenge is establishing a productive community culture. However, moderation, campus management software and an easy-to-use interface makes this easy.</p>
