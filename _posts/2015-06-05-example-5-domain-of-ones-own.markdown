what: <p>Domain of One's Own provides students and faculty with web hosting and domains to build a portfolio of their work on the web.</p> 
how: <p>All work is aggregated back to the central site, but rather than having authorship happen in a silo, students are given their own distinct domains and spaces to narrate their work and explore the possibities.</p>
equity: <p>Domain of One's Own puts students in control of their own data. The space is theirs and they are not restricted to a limited toolset to express themselves. By giving students and faculty spaces to promote the work they're doing, we are giving them the power to control who accesses their data and how it's presented on the web.</p>
origin: <p>Domain of One's Own started at the University of Mary Washington in 2012 as a pilot launched after years of experimentation within the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies with Bluehost as a toolkit for innovation. UMW has a <a href="http://umwblogs.org">rich history of working with WordPress</a> and wanted to push the boundaries of this by offering a LAMP hosting environment that allowed students to get their own spaces and connect to a domain they owned and controlled. After a successful pilot in 2012 the project was funded ongoing and currently boasts over 1,400 users and almost 2,000 sites.</p><p>In 2013 Tim Owens and Jim Groom launched <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a> as an effort to provide hosted infrastructure for other schools who didn't have the resources to run similar projects. Schools like <a href="http://emorydomains.org">Emory University</a> were already experimenting with these spaces and now there are 11 institutions doing Domain of One's Own on their campus ranging from small pilots to larger programs with more schedule for the Fall.</p>

skills: <p>An understanding of cPanel helps when supporting an environment like this. In many ways because this is the ultimate sandbox you have to have an expectation that things will go wrong on occasion and be prepared to work through those trials. Support from your IT department is crucial if you don't have technical expertise in running a server environment and you're not working with an external company like Reclaim Hosting.</p>
