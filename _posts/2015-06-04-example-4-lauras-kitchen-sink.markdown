project-date: Same two classes evolving since 2002
platform: RSS, HTML, Javascript, Inoreader, RotateContent, Google Docs
examples: <a href="http://3043.mythfolklore.net/" target="_blank">3043 Myth-Folklore Hub</a>, <a href="http://4993.mythfolklore.net/" target="_blank">4993 Indian Epics Hub</a>

what: <p>I'm an online instructor on an eternal quest for RSS and randomization tools to manage my class blog networks.</p> 
how: <p>As each student creates their own blog, I use RSS in Inoreader to create a blog network. Meanwhile, to help students explore the course content and the blog network, I rely on the power of randomization tools.</p>
equity: <p>As the creators and owners of their own blogs and websites, students design their own spaces and create the most important course content. With randomization, I try to boost everyone's presence and awareness of others in the class. My goal is to use free tools which do not require lots of technical expertise so that all my students can, in turn, use any/all of these same web-based tools for their own purposes.</p>
origin: <p>I've been teaching Myth-Folklore and Indian Epics fully online since 2002. The range of tools that I have used over that time has been enormous. Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines" target="_blank">Bloglines</a>? Yep, that was the feed reader I used for a long time, and my students blogged using the blogging tool built into Bloglines. Different tools come and go, but the magic of RSS and randomization have been my friends from the start-- the magic of RSS to gather and the magic of randomization to explore. More about the history of my classes at <a href="http://anatomy.lauragibbs.net/" target="_blank">Anatomy of an Online Course</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the standard LMS packages (first Blackboard, now D2L) have been useless for my purposes, cut off from the open Internet as they are with no support for student web publishing or blogging (you know, real blogging... not the faux blogs of the LMS). My school has invested the lion's share of its time and money into the support of the standard LMS along with a new multimillion dollar MOOC LMS that we have developed (also cut off from the Internet with no RSS or randomization features), which is why I have had to go "into the wild," using hosted tools that fit my very limited technical skills.</p><p>We now have a pilot of <a href="http://create.ou.edu/" target="_blank">Domain of One's Own at my school</a>. Will that finally bring an open blogging culture along with it? Perhaps this is the DoOO David that will topple our LMS Goliath. Or, if not that, I am hopeful that at least a few more faculty members will give student blogging a try! </p><p>Meanwhile, I will continue the eternal quest to find powerful, reliable and free/cheap web-based tools to support student blogging and web publishing, and I am grateful to the people behind tools like <a href="http://inoreader.com/" target="_blank">Inoreader</a> and <a href="http://RotateContent.com/" target="_blank">RotateContent</a> for the great opportunities they are providing. Whether you use Blogger or WordPress or some other blogging platform, you might it useful to explore the RSS syndication features at Inoreader and the randomized content widgets at RotateContent.</p> 
demolinks: <ul> <li><strong><a href="http://3043.mythfolklore.net/index.html">Course Hubs</a></strong> -  RSS can gather up your course blogs so that you can read them in one place and also share that combined stream with others.</li> <li><strong><a href="http://3043.mythfolklore.net/lastwords.html">Assignment Streams</a></strong> -  RSS can also gather specific content from all the course blogs (like different types of assignments) into combined streams.</li> <li><strong><a href="http://inoreader.com/">Inoreader.com</a></strong> -  I use Inoreader to aggregate the blog posts, manage my blog reading, and also create combined streams to share with others.</li> <li><strong><a href="http://estorybook.blogspot.com/2010/12/indian-epic-storybooks.html">Randomized Student Projects</a></strong> -  Random content widgets allow you to explore lots of content in a way that is fun and also efficient.</li> <li><strong><a href="http://rotatecontent.com/">RotateContent.com</a></strong> -  I use RotateContent to turn simple HTML tables into randomizing widgets (it writes the javascript for you).</li> <li><strong><a href="http://onlinecourselady.pbworks.com/w/page/96929079/samplebloggroups">Randomized Blog Groups</a></strong> -  To help students connect with lots of other students in class, I use a simple spreadsheet to create random groups.</li> </ul>

tech: <ul> <li><a href="http://RotateContent.com/" target="_blank">RotateContent.com</a> (free) generates javascripts from HTML tables</li> <li><a href="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">GoogleDocs</a> Sheets (free) works as a handy randomizer</li> <li><a href="http://inoreader.com" target="_blank">Inoreader.com</a> (free, with premium features ranging from $15-$60/year) RSS aggregation-syndication)</li> </ul>
skills: <ul> <li>GoogleDocs Sheets- basic spreadsheet knowledge</li> <li>Inoreader.com- basic understanding of RSS </li> <li>RotateContent.com- basic knowledge of HTML</li> </ul>
examplelist: <p>You can find lots of examples from my classes documented at the <a href="http://anatomy.lauragibbs.net/" target="_blank">Anatomy of an Online Course blog</a>. It has sections devoted to student blogging, Inoreader, randomizers, etc.</p>
guides: <p>I've tried to provide enough information at <a href="http://anatomy.lauragibbs.net/" target="_blank">Anatomy of an Online Course blog</a> to help people try these RSS and randomization strategies in their own classes. If I have missed anything, let me know. Any/all excuses to add more blog posts are welcome!

challenges: <ul> <li>Students often have never shared any of their work in public before, and most of my students have never blogged. Luckily, the experience is a great one, and the problem goes away as soon as they start enjoying each other's blogs in the first days of class. </li> <li>Curious faculty ask me how to do these things inside D2L. I explain that they cannot do these things in D2L. That is a problem for which I see no easy solution. One of my hopes for attending the DML conference is to learn ways to promote a sense of adventure among other faculty, especially other faculty already teaching online, so that they will want to go beyond the LMS using simple, free tools to create learning networks where students can create and share their work with one another.</li> </ul>
