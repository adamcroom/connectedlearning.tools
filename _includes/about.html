                    <p>This show brings together the experiences of people who have been immersed in open learning via designs that mimic the distributed/connected network of the internet itself, where the fundamental organizing units are the students/participants, learners who manage their own digital spaces.</p>

                    <p>The course then becomes one of many spaces fueled by the flow of individual actions. When we shift the locus of learning outside of an institutional platform, students gain agency over their experiences, something that meshes with the larger world they operate in beyond school.</p>

                    <p>There is no single easy button template driven platform to build these kinds of environments, yet they are eminently achievable with open source or free tools running on the open web; millions of dollars of funding is not required. These are a mix and remix of both old and new technologies, co-mingling emergent ones with what <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2013/10/11/moocs-need-to-be-user-innovation-toolkits/">Jon Udell describes as trailing-edge ones</a>.</p>
